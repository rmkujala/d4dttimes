This repository contains the python code for extracting travel times between different locations as provided by Orange for the Data for Development Challenge Senegal (D4D 2014).
(See http://www.d4d.orange.com/en/home/ )

The format of the input data is defined in http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4885

This package provides only the 'minimal set' of tools for extracting travel times from CDR data.
For more sophisticated pipelining of the data, you may contact the author of this repository.
(This code is a stripped down version of the actual research code.)
